#### Note

If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

Preview models will eventually be removed by Google and unfortunately won't be redirected to finished equivalents. If this happens, please report it or, better yet, you can change here by yourself.

##### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a problem that the app is slower in the background than in the foreground (branch Faster_background_speed).

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch System_message_handover). The current workaround is to go from the home screen.
