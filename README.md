### Google Crawler Bug

Unfortunately, the Google crawler seems to no longer index many new repos and other sites. This one and the workaround produced repos are among them, but you can still find this via Bing, Ecosia and Yahoo.

### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch Better_text).

Correct implementation of MediaProjection (Create screenshots for Gemini). Almost finished code in the screenshot branch. The current workaround is to trigger a screenshot via the accessibility service. However, this leads to the thumbnail.
