### How to get it from Google Play
<br/>

Unfortunately, I need 12 testers for 14 days to publish the app on the Play Store and Google doesn't even update the index of this page. ðŸ’©

For the Play Store link to work you must first join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/Screen_Operator) You can then download it regularly from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.android_poweruser).

#### Note

If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

Android 11-12.1 doesn't work because of file permission problems with the screenshots path. Participate in the Project (branch better_text or Android_11_read_media_images). Please test yourself if Android 10- works and let me know the result.

##### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch Better_text). The current workaround is to go from the home screen.

Correct implementation of MediaProjection (Create screenshots for Gemini). Almost finished code in the screenshot branch. The current workaround is to trigger a screenshot via the accessibility service. However, this leads to the thumbnail.
