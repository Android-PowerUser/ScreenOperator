### How to get it from Google Play
<br/>

Unfortunately, Google's "review" of apps takes a very long time. You can also download it from this site.

For the Play Store link to work you must first join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/Screen_Operator). You can then download it regularly from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.android_poweruser).

#### Note

If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

##### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a problem that the app is slower in the background than in the foreground (branch Faster_background_speed).

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch Better_text). The current workaround is to go from the home screen.
