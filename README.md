### How to get it from Google Play
<br/>

I must all „Tester“ E-Mails enter in the list of the Google Play Console, because „Every developer has to have his app tested extensively to publish it regular“. Google determines the time frame for all this. Unfortunately, this all takes about a month.

Here can you enter an E-Mail. [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wQiKmP9R2PTmZQe\_1ZAp3KCv9M8\_d9nlqoLsLot2M-I/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wQiKmP9R2PTmZQe_1ZAp3KCv9M8_d9nlqoLsLot2M-I/edit) You get a notification when I enter it in the console. You can then download it regularly from the Play Store.

#### Note

If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

Android 12 doesn't work because of file permission problems with the screenshots path. Participate in the Project (branch better_text).

##### Help with development

Current development step:

Fix a bug that prevents some apps from being launched by Screen Operator (branch Better_text). The current workaround is to go from the home screen.

Correct implementation of MediaProjection (Create screenshots for Gemini). Almost finished code in the screenshot branch. The current workaround is to trigger a screenshot via the accessibility service. However, this leads to the thumbnail.
