#### Note

Version 1.1 doesn't work on 
Android 13-, and some APIs were disabled in version 1.0. I'm trying to fix this.

If you in your Google account identified as under 18, you need an adult account because Google is (unreasonably) denying you the API key.

Preview models will eventually be removed by Google and unfortunately won't be redirected to finished equivalents. If this happens, please report it or, better yet, you can change here by yourself.
